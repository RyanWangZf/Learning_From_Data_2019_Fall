# logistic regression on MNIST binary image classification.

# I have completed the major framework, you can fill the space 
# to make it work.
# By the way, achieving the logistic regression with Numpy 
# is a classical coding problem when you confront to 
# look for an intern in some AI labs. 
# So u may treat this as the rehearsal.
# Gooood luck for your first programming assignment. ;)
